MLL3 Loss Drives Metastasis by Promoting a Hybrid Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition State

Abstract
Phenotypic plasticity associated with the hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) state is
crucial to metastatic seeding and outgrowth. However, the mechanisms controlling the induction
of hybrid EMT remain poorly defined. We showed that deletion of the epigenetic regulator MLL3,
a tumor suppressor frequently altered in human cancer, promoted the acquisition of the hybrid
EMT state in both epithelial and mesenchymal breast cancer cells by facilitating EMT and MET,
distinct from other known EMT regulators mediating unidirectional changes. Consequently,
MLL3 deletion greatly increased metastasis by enhancing metastatic outgrowth during
colonization. Mechanistically, MLL3 loss led to IFNg signaling upregulation, which contributes to
the induction of hybrid EMT cells and the enhanced metastatic capacity. We further showed that
MLL3-deficient cells were sensitive to BET inhibition, which effectively suppressed the growth of
MLL3-mutant primary tumors and metastases. These results uncovered a key driver of the
hybrid EMT state in breast cancer that could be targeted therapeutically.
